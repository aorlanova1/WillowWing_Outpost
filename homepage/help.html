        <td>How can I keep my save?</td>
        <td>Your horses and items will be kept as long as local storage/cache is not cleared. This is usually done where you clear browser history, so if you want to keep your save file, be careful when selecting options in clearing cookies/local storage/history.

            Browser data will not be stored across different browsers. A save file on Safari won't be available on Chrome.
            <br>
            If you really want to keep all data, always, but want to disalow cookies normally, you can use a seperate browser for just this game in which you don't clear your cache.
